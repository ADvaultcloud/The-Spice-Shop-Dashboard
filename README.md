## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Transformation

The source data was initially available in **one Excel file** containing sales data for all months combined.  

### Steps Performed:
1. **Initial Cleanup**  
   - Removed blank rows and unnecessary columns.  
   - Standardized column names (e.g., `Product Name`, `Weight`, `Total Prints`, `Month`).  
   - Converted data types (dates, numeric values).

2. **Splitting by Month**  
   - Using Power Query in Power BI (or Excel VBA/Python if needed), the single file was transformed into **separate files**, each representing a **single monthâ€™s sales data**.  
   - Naming convention:  
     ```
     Jan_2025.xlsx
     Feb_2025.xlsx
     Mar_2025.xlsx
     ...
     ```
   - This modular approach makes it easier for clients to update/replace data month by month.

3. **Parameter for Data Source**  
   - A **parameter** (`FileLocation`) was created in Power BI to dynamically fetch the correct monthly file.  
   - Clients can update the file path to point to a specific monthâ€™s dataset.

## ðŸ“‚ Data Source Parameter Setup

To make this dashboard portable and allow clients to connect to their own data files, a **parameter** has been created in Power BI.

### Steps to Configure:
1. Open the Power BI file (`masala_box_dashboard.pbix`).
2. Go to **Home > Transform Data > Manage Parameters**.
3. Update the parameter **`FileLocation`**:
   - Enter the full path to your monthly data file (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Sales_Jan2025.xlsx`).
4. Save changes and click **Apply**.
5. Refresh the dataset to load data from the specified file location.
